**Topic:** Engineering
**Confidentiality:** MEMBER only.

We are evaluating Rust for performance-critical components. The AI model training infrastructure is now live. The deployment pipeline now fully supports blue-green deployments.

Technical debt reduction is a priority for this sprint. The deployment pipeline now fully supports blue-green deployments. Code review turnaround time has decreased by 20%.

We are evaluating Rust for performance-critical components. Latency issues in the database layer have been resolved. The new microservices architecture improved system scalability.
